## Inkan.link SAS
 Inkan.link SAS is a startup founded in 2021 by experienced cybersecurity professionals and a lawyer.

## Certifying your statements through digital attestation chaining

Everyone leaves digital footprints on various systems. These data generally do not benefit the user. At best, state authorities use them for criminal cases. This data is valuable in terms of security, as it is easy to create and difficult to usurp.

Imagine if these systems could attest that they hold data related to a specific user, automatically and at the user's request. This would open up a new category in the digital world! Data could now benefit users and serve to create a reliable information source. Moreover, we could create a new class of paperless and PDF-less services without providers needing to invest in complex cybersecurity solutions to publish the data. Data verification would now rely on multi-factor certifications, generated with each statement.

We aim to create a range of privacy-friendly and frictionless services, even when registering sensitive data. We address a trust crisis with technology providers by offering Inkan expertise to our clients.

## Where does our name come from?

Inkan is a Japanese word for a signature with a seal. It symbolizes our approach to generating verifiable and fully private data, and then using it on behalf of the data owner in direct digital services.

Our first product, Sealfie, is a play on words between the seal for signing things and the selfie. Your data on any system becomes a verifiable signature, with no need for scribbling.
