## Inkan.link SAS

Is a startup created in 2021 by seasoned cybersecurity professional and lawyer.

## Trust in data by chaining multiple certifications

Everyone leaves digital traces on many systems. Those data never benefit the user; at best, lawful entities use them in criminal cases. Those data are precious from a security point of view because they are easy to create and hard to alter.

Imagine if those systems could certify that they have data related to a specific user, automatically, on sole demand of the user. It opens up a new category in the digital world; data can now benefit the users to create a trusted source of information. Furthermore,  we can create a new class of paperless and "pdfless" services without the need for the provider to invest in complex cybersecurity solutions to post verify the data. Verification of data now depends on multi-factor certifications.

We aim at creating a range of services, privacy native, frictionless, even if taping in sensitive data.
We solve a trust crisis with technology providers by having Inkan technology expertise on the customer's side.

## Names

Inkan is a Japanese word for the signature with a seal. It represents our approach to generate verifiable and fully private data then use it on behalf of the data owner for direct digitally based services.

Our first product [Sealfie](https://sealf.ie) is a play on words between the seal to sign things and the selfie. Your data on any system make a verifiable signature, no more doodling.
