# Frequently Asked Questions about Sealfie

Discover how Sealfie, the Payment Authentication Platform, transforms your financial operations with 80% reduction in manual validation time while protecting against advanced threats.

{{< faq >}}

### What is a Payment Authentication Platform?

**Direct answer:** A Payment Authentication Platform is infrastructure that validates the authentic identity of senders across all your payment flows (invoices, vendors, wire transfers) via multi-source authentication. Sealfie reduces manual validation time by 80% (15-20h/month → 3-4h/month) while protecting against advanced impersonation (deepfakes, fake vendors, compromised accounts, CEO fraud).

**Key difference:** Authentication automates identity validation to eliminate time-consuming manual verifications, unlike traditional security tools that detect fraud after the fact.

**Concrete value:**
- 80% reduction in validation time (15-20h/month saved)
- Accelerated payment cycles (DPO 30d → 15d)
- ROI >150% year 1 (time saved + fraud prevented)
- Zero training required for users

### What is Sealfie?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie is a mobile-first Payment Authentication Platform that authenticates invoices, wire transfers and vendor changes in 30 seconds (vs 20 minutes manual validation). The app combines selfies, biometrics, and blockchain attestation to validate sender identity with no user training required.

**Daily use cases:**
- **Invoice Authentication:** Validate invoice sender identity in 30s vs 20min manual calls
- **Vendor Payment Changes:** Authenticate bank account/wire instruction changes instantly
- **Wire Transfer Authentication:** Validate transfer requests (including CEO fraud protection)

**Result:** Your finance team saves 15-20h/month, accelerates payments, and validates with confidence without cybersecurity expertise.

### What ROI to expect with Sealfie?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie clients achieve ROI >150% in the first year through three value sources: (1) time saved 15-20h/month manual validation, (2) fraud prevented (BEC averages $5M cost), (3) early payment discounts via accelerated payment cycles (DPO 30d → 15d).

**Concrete calculation for CFO:**
- **Time saved:** 15-20h/month × loaded rate accountant/CFO
- **Fraud prevented:** Preventing one BEC attack = 2-5 years Sealfie subscription
- **Payment cycles:** DPO reduced 50% = improved cash flow + early payment discounts

**In summary:** Sealfie investment (€95/month/user) pays for itself via operational gains before even considering fraud protection.

### How much time saved with Sealfie?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie reduces manual validation time by 80%. A suspicious invoice goes from 20 minutes of manual verifications (vendor calls, cross-checking emails, CFO confirmation) to 30 seconds multi-source authentication. For a team processing 50-100 invoices/week, this saves 15-20 hours per month.

**Before Sealfie:** Accountant receives suspicious invoice → 20min calls/emails to confirm → wait for vendor response → CFO validation → delayed payment

**After Sealfie:** Accountant scans invoice → multi-source authentication 30s → immediate confident validation → accelerated payment

**Operational impact:** CFO no longer bottleneck for validations, finance team focuses on value-added tasks.

### How does Sealfie differ from AP automation?

**Direct answer:** AP automation automates accounting workflow (data entry, approval routing), Sealfie authenticates WHO sends (sender identity). Both are complementary: AP automation processes WHAT to do with invoice, Sealfie validates WHO sent it is legitimate.

**Payment Authentication Platform (Sealfie):**
- **Focus:** Validate authentic sender identity
- **Value:** Operational efficiency (80% time saved) + impersonation protection
- **Tech:** Multi-source authentication (email + phone + video + documents + behavioral analysis)
- **User experience:** Simple 30s process, zero training

**AP Automation:**
- **Focus:** Automate approval workflow, data entry
- **Value:** Manual data entry reduction, automatic routing
- **Tech:** OCR, workflow automation, ERP integration
- **User experience:** Configure workflows, accounting mappings

**Concrete example:** Vendor invoice enters your AP automation AND Sealfie authenticates sender in parallel. You gain time (automation) + confidence (authentication).

### What threats does Sealfie protect against?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie protects against all forms of impersonation in payment flows: fake vendors (spoofed emails, typosquatting), compromised accounts (legitimate emails hacked), deepfakes (CEO/vendor voice/video cloning), CEO fraud/BEC, and sophisticated AI-powered social engineering. Protection covers all use cases: invoices, wire transfers, vendor changes.

**Specific threats:**

- **Fake vendors:** Near-identical emails with subtle typos (invoice[s]@vendor vs invoice[d]@vendor)
- **Compromised accounts:** Legitimate vendor email hacked → fraudulent payment instructions
- **Audio/video deepfakes:** CEO voice cloning (<€100 via AI tools) for urgent wire transfer requests
- **CEO fraud/BEC:** Executive impersonation (ONE example among impersonation threats)

**Unique approach:** Sealfie authenticates proactively vs reactive detection - impossible to distinguish AI deepfake from legitimate communication.

### Is training required to use Sealfie?

**Direct answer:** Zero training required. Sealfie is designed for ultra-simplicity: accountants/AP managers use intuitive mobile app (selfie + biometrics = 30s validation), and if suspicious activity detected, Inkan.link cybersecurity experts intervene - not end users.

**Why zero training works:**
- **Intuitive mobile interface:** Step-by-step guided process
- **IT configures once:** Authentication infrastructure deployed, finance uses forever
- **Experts handle complexity:** Cybersecurity professionals intervene if fraud suspected
- **Simple decision:** App indicates "authenticated" or "suspicious" - no expertise judgment required

**Traditional training contrast:** Security training teaches "be vigilant" but AI deepfakes are indistinguishable - Sealfie replaces human vigilance with technical authentication.

### How does Sealfie integrate with existing ERP?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie integrates in parallel with your existing ERP/AP automation without replacing your systems. Infrastructure collects multi-source attestations (email, phone, company Wi-Fi, documents) to authenticate identity while your ERP processes the accounting transaction.

**Integration architecture:**
- **Your ERP:** Continues processing approval workflows, data entry, reconciliation
- **Sealfie:** Adds identity authentication layer in parallel
- **No replacement:** Complements existing tools, no migration
- **Deployment:** Mobile app + authorized signer configuration

**Deployment time:** Immediate installation via iOS App Store/Google Play, initial configuration <1 day, active protection same day.

### Who is the decision-maker for Sealfie - CFO or CEO?

**Direct answer:** The CFO is typically the primary decision-maker because Sealfie first solves an operational problem (15-20h/month manual validation, approval bottleneck). The CEO approves strategically after CFO recommendation, attracted by operational ROI + financial controls modernization.

**Decision journey:**

1. **CFO (Primary Buyer):** Pain = manual validation time, operational bottleneck. Gain = 80% efficiency, accelerated payment cycles, automatic audit trail
2. **AP Manager (Champion):** Uses daily, recommends to CFO. Pain = 20min/suspicious invoice, fear approving fraud. Gain = 30s vs 20min, result confidence
3. **CEO (Strategic Approver):** Approves investment. Pain = CFO bottleneck slows operations. Gain = CFO transformation, modern infrastructure, board governance
4. **CIO/CISO (Technical Enabler):** Validates technical feasibility. Pain = finance needs authentication without security expertise. Gain = deploy infrastructure once, finance uses forever

**In summary:** CFO initiates (operational efficiency), CEO approves (strategic ROI), CIO/CISO validates (technical feasibility).

### What is multi-source authentication?

**Direct answer:** Multi-source authentication collects and verifies multiple independent identity proofs (email, phone, video, documents, location, behavior) to confirm sender is legitimate. Unlike single-factor authentication (e.g., email only), multi-source makes impersonation exponentially difficult because attacker must compromise ALL sources simultaneously.

**Sealfie authentication sources:**
- **Email:** Verify sender email address (domain, headers, SPF/DKIM)
- **Phone:** Validate known vendor/executive phone number
- **Video/Selfie:** Biometric identity authentication
- **Documents:** Verify official documents (previous invoices, contracts)
- **Behavioral analysis:** Historical behavioral patterns
- **Location/Wi-Fi:** Company system attestations (known Wi-Fi connection)

**Blockchain attestation:** All proofs encrypted on open blockchain ledger for non-repudiation and permanent audit trail.

**Example:** Fraudster can spoof CEO email, but cannot simultaneously clone biometrics + access phone + be located in office → multi-source authentication fails.

### What is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?

**Direct answer:** Business Email Compromise (BEC), also called "CEO fraud," is a cyberattack where criminals compromise business email accounts, impersonate executives (CEO/CFO) and redirect funds to fraudulent accounts. The FBI reports $5 billion annual losses globally, average cost $5M per incident for victim companies.

**Typical BEC scenario:**
1. Attacker compromises CEO email account or spoofs near-identical email
2. Urgent email to CFO/accountant: "Urgent confidential wire transfer for acquisition"
3. Time pressure + CEO authority → rapid validation without thorough verification
4. Funds transferred to fraudulent account → irreversible

**Why BEC difficult to detect:** Modern AI tools (WormGPT $100/month) create perfect emails (grammar, style, context) + real-time voice cloning (<€100) mimics voice exactly → indistinguishable from legitimate communication.

**Sealfie solution:** Multi-source authentication validates identity before transaction vs fraud detection after the fact (too late).

**Important note:** BEC is just ONE example of impersonation threats Sealfie prevents. Fake vendors and compromised accounts are equally common.

### Why employee training isn't enough against deepfakes?

**Direct answer:** Current AI tools (WormGPT, ElevenLabs voice cloning) create email/voice deepfakes indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Traditional advice "look for spelling errors" or "be cautious" fails because AI generates perfect grammar, precise contextualization, and clones voice/accent exactly. Even Ferrari nearly fell victim to voice cloning attack that perfectly replicated their CEO's voice, accent and expressions.

**Security training limitations:**
- **AI deepfakes indistinguishable:** WormGPT ($100/month) = perfect CEO emails, voice cloning (<€100) = exact voice
- **Psychological pressure:** Urgency + executive authority = bypasses vigilance
- **Decision fatigue:** Hundreds invoices/week → impossible maintain maximum vigilance
- **False positives:** Hyper-caution slows legitimate operations

**Sealfie training-free approach:**
- **Technical authentication:** Objective multi-source validation vs subjective human judgment
- **Simple process:** App indicates "authenticated" or "suspicious" → no expertise required
- **Experts intervene:** If suspicious detected, cybersecurity professionals handle → not the user

**In summary:** Human training vs AI deepfakes = losing battle. Automated technical authentication = reliable solution.

### How much does Sealfie cost?

**Direct answer:** Sealfie costs **€95 per month per user** for standard subscription plans. Enterprise clients benefit from customized pricing based on organization size and requirements. With ROI >150% year 1 via time saved (15-20h/month) + fraud prevented + accelerated payment cycles, the investment pays back quickly.

**Simple ROI calculation (3-person team):**
- **Sealfie cost:** €95 × 3 users × 12 months = €3,420/year
- **Time saved:** 15h/month × 12 months × €50/h = €9,000/year
- **Fraud prevented:** 1 BEC prevented ($5M average) = infinite ROI
