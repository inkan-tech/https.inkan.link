# Frequently Asked Questions about Sealfie and Inkan.link

Learn how Sealfie protects your business from CEO fraud, voice cloning, and Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.

{{< faq >}}

### What is Inkan.link?

Inkan.link is a European DeepTech startup founded in October 2021 specializing in deepfake protection for business transactions. Our flagship product Sealfie protects enterprises from Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud, voice cloning attacks, and AI-powered CEO impersonation through patented blockchain-based multi-factor verification developed in partnership with L3i Laboratory at the University of La Rochelle.

### What is Sealfie?

Sealfie is a mobile-first verification platform that prevents Business Email Compromise (BEC) and CEO fraud through multi-factor authentication including selfies, biometrics, and blockchain attestation. The platform protects businesses from the $5 billion in annual losses caused by AI-powered social engineering attacks, requiring no user training with an intuitive mobile interface.

### How does Sealfie prevent CEO fraud?

Sealfie requires multi-source verification for financial transactions: authorized individuals take selfies, provide biometric authentication, and generate digital certificates. The system collects attestations from multiple sources (including company systems like Wi-Fi) and encrypts them on an open blockchain ledger. If verification fails or fraud is suspected, expert cybersecurity professionals intervene immediately - no user training required.

### How much does Sealfie cost?

Sealfie is priced at **€95/month per user** for standard subscription plans. Enterprise clients benefit from customized solutions with pricing tailored to organization size and requirements. The platform deploys instantly through major app stores and scales effortlessly. Contact us for a demo and detailed pricing tailored to your needs.

### Who should use Sealfie?

Sealfie is essential for CFOs, accountants, financial controllers, treasurers, CEOs, and any business personnel who approve wire transfers, payment instructions, or financial transactions. Organizations processing significant financial transactions are most vulnerable to BEC fraud. Key industries include financial services, manufacturing, legal services, healthcare, and any enterprise handling regular wire transfers.

### What is Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud?

Business Email Compromise (BEC), also called "Fake CEO Scam," is a sophisticated cyberattack where criminals compromise business email accounts, impersonate executives (typically CEOs or CFOs), and redirect funds to fraudulent accounts. The FBI reports $5 billion in annual losses globally, making it one of the most costly cybersecurity threats.

### Why can't traditional security training stop deepfake fraud?

Criminals now use AI tools like WormGPT ($100/month) to create perfect CEO email impersonations and real-time voice cloning (<€100) to mimic voices exactly. Traditional advice like "look for spelling errors" or "be cautious" fails because AI-generated attacks are indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Even Ferrari nearly fell victim to a voice cloning attack that perfectly replicated their CEO's voice, accent, and expressions.

### Do employees need training to use Sealfie?

No. Sealfie is designed for ultra-simplicity with no training required. The mobile app interface is intuitive - users simply take selfies and provide biometric verification during transaction approval. When suspicious activity occurs, IT professionals and cybersecurity experts handle the investigation, not the end users.

### What makes Sealfie different from traditional fraud prevention?

Traditional fraud prevention asks employees "what they did wrong" after attacks succeed. Sealfie empowers IT professionals to prevent fraud before it happens through proactive multi-factor verification. The approach shifts from detecting fraudulent activities (nearly impossible with AI deepfakes) to making legitimate transactions verifiably authentic through multiple sources.

### Is Sealfie compatible with our existing systems?

Yes. Sealfie integrates with existing business processes and can collect digital certificates from other systems (such as company Wi-Fi networks). The mobile-first platform works alongside your current email, payment, and financial approval systems without requiring infrastructure changes.

### What happens if fraud is detected?

When Sealfie detects suspicious activity, IT professionals from Inkan.link (and partner companies like ShareID.ai in integrated deployments) spring into action immediately. The system guides users through necessary verification steps and provides expert investigation - no end-user fraud expertise required.

### How quickly can we deploy Sealfie?

Sealfie is available immediately through iOS App Store and Google Play. Organizations can start protecting transactions the same day by installing the mobile app and configuring authorized signers. Global accessibility with instant deployment and effortless scaling.

### Is Sealfie GDPR compliant?

Yes. Inkan.link is a European DeepTech company based in France, with solutions designed for GDPR compliance from the ground up. Blockchain attestations are encrypted and stored on an open ledger that provides security and auditability while respecting data privacy regulations.

### What types of attacks does Sealfie prevent?

Sealfie protects against Business Email Compromise (BEC), fake CEO emails, voice cloning attacks, deepfake video calls, urgent wire transfer fraud, fraudulent payment instruction changes, and AI-powered impersonation attacks. Any transaction requiring executive approval is protected through multi-factor verification.
