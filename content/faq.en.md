## Frequently Asked Questions about Sealfie

Discover how Sealfie, the Payment Authentication Platform, transforms your financial operations with 80% reduction in manual validation time while protecting against advanced threats.

{{< faq >}}

### What is a Payment Authentication Platform?

Infrastructure that validates the authentic identity of senders across all your payment flows via multi-source authentication. Sealfie reduces manual validation time by 80% (15-20h/month → 3-4h/month) while protecting against advanced impersonation.

**Learn more:**
- **Key difference:** Automates identity validation to eliminate time-consuming manual verifications
- **Measurable gains:** 80% time saved, DPO 30d → 15d, ROI >150% year 1
- **Zero training:** No user training required
- **Complete protection:** Deepfakes, fake vendors, compromised accounts, CEO fraud

### What is Sealfie?

A mobile-first Payment Authentication Platform that authenticates invoices, wire transfers and vendor changes in 30 seconds via selfies, biometrics and blockchain attestation.

**Learn more:**
- **Invoice Authentication:** Validate sender identity in 30s vs 20min manual calls
- **Vendor Payment Changes:** Authenticate bank account changes instantly
- **Wire Transfer Authentication:** Validate transfer requests (including CEO fraud)
- **Concrete result:** Finance team saves 15-20h/month, accelerates payments, validates with confidence

### What ROI to expect with Sealfie?

ROI >150% in the first year through three sources: time saved (15-20h/month), fraud prevented (BEC averages $5M), and early payment discounts (DPO 30d → 15d).

**Learn more:**
- **Time saved:** 15-20h/month × loaded accountant/CFO rate
- **Fraud prevented:** One BEC attack prevented = 2-5 years Sealfie subscription
- **Payment cycles:** DPO reduced 50% = improved cash flow + discounts
- **Investment:** €95/month/user paid back via operational gains alone

### How much time saved with Sealfie?

80% reduction in manual validation time. A suspicious invoice goes from 20 minutes of manual verifications to 30 seconds multi-source authentication. Saves 15-20h/month for team processing 50-100 invoices/week.

**Learn more:**
- **Before Sealfie:** Suspicious invoice → 20min calls/emails → wait response → CFO validation → delayed payment
- **After Sealfie:** Scan invoice → authentication 30s → immediate validation → accelerated payment
- **Impact:** CFO no longer bottleneck, finance team focuses on value-added tasks

### How does Sealfie differ from AP automation?

AP automation automates accounting workflow, Sealfie authenticates sender identity. Both are complementary: AP automation processes WHAT to do, Sealfie validates WHO sends.

**Learn more:**
- **Sealfie:** Validates authentic sender identity - efficiency (80% time) + protection
- **AP Automation:** Automates approval workflows, data entry, routing
- **Complementary:** Invoice enters AP automation + Sealfie authenticates sender in parallel
- **Result:** Time gained (automation) + confidence (authentication)

### What threats does Sealfie protect against?

All forms of impersonation in payment flows: fake vendors, compromised accounts, audio/video deepfakes, CEO fraud/BEC, AI-powered social engineering. Protection covers all use cases: invoices, wire transfers, vendor changes.

**Learn more:**
- **Fake vendors:** Spoofed emails with subtle typos nearly undetectable
- **Compromised accounts:** Legitimate email hacked with fraudulent payment instructions
- **Deepfakes:** CEO voice cloning (<€100) for urgent wire transfers
- **Unique approach:** Proactive authentication vs reactive detection (too late)

### Is training required to use Sealfie?

Zero training required. Intuitive mobile interface (selfie + biometrics = 30s validation). If suspicious activity, Inkan.link cybersecurity experts intervene - not end users.

**Learn more:**
- **Intuitive interface:** Step-by-step guided process
- **IT configures once:** Infrastructure deployed, finance uses forever
- **Experts handle complexity:** Professionals intervene if fraud suspected
- **Training contrast:** "Be vigilant" fails against indistinguishable AI deepfakes

### How does Sealfie integrate with existing ERP?

Sealfie integrates in parallel with your ERP/AP automation without replacement. Collects multi-source attestations to authenticate identity while your ERP processes the transaction.

**Learn more:**
- **Your ERP:** Continues processing approval workflows, data entry, reconciliation
- **Sealfie:** Adds identity authentication layer in parallel
- **Deployment:** Mobile app + authorized signer configuration
- **Time:** Immediate iOS/Android installation, config <1 day, active protection same day

### Who is the decision-maker for Sealfie - CFO or CEO?

The CFO is typically the primary decision-maker (solves operational problem: 15-20h/month manual validation). The CEO approves strategically after CFO recommendation (operational ROI + financial controls modernization).

**Learn more:**
- **CFO (Primary Buyer):** Pain = operational bottleneck. Gain = 80% efficiency, accelerated payment cycles
- **AP Manager (Champion):** Pain = 20min/invoice, fraud fear. Gain = 30s, confidence
- **CEO (Strategic Approver):** Pain = CFO bottleneck. Gain = transformation, governance
- **CIO/CISO (Technical Enabler):** Deploy infrastructure once, finance uses forever

### What is multi-source authentication?

Collects and verifies multiple independent identity proofs (email, phone, video, documents, location) to confirm sender is legitimate. Attacker must compromise ALL sources simultaneously - exponentially difficult.

**Learn more:**
- **Sources:** Email (SPF/DKIM), phone, video/selfie biometric, documents, behavioral analysis, Wi-Fi
- **Blockchain:** All proofs encrypted on open ledger for non-repudiation
- **Example:** Fraudster can spoof CEO email, but cannot clone biometrics + access phone + be located in office simultaneously

### What is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?

Cyberattack where criminals compromise business email accounts, impersonate executives and redirect funds to fraudulent accounts. FBI reports $5 billion annual losses, average cost $5M per incident.

**Learn more:**
- **Typical scenario:** Urgent CEO email → confidential wire transfer → time pressure + authority → rapid validation → funds lost
- **Why difficult:** AI tools (WormGPT $100/month) create perfect emails + voice cloning (<€100) indistinguishable
- **Sealfie solution:** Multi-source authentication before transaction vs detection after the fact
- **Note:** BEC is just ONE example - fake vendors and compromised accounts equally common

### Why employee training isn't enough against deepfakes?

Current AI tools create email/voice deepfakes indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Advice "look for spelling errors" fails because AI generates perfect grammar and clones voice exactly. Even Ferrari nearly fell victim to perfect CEO voice cloning.

**Learn more:**
- **Training limitations:** Indistinguishable deepfakes, psychological pressure, decision fatigue, false positives slow operations
- **Sealfie approach:** Objective technical authentication vs subjective human judgment
- **Simple process:** App indicates "authenticated" or "suspicious" - no expertise required
- **Conclusion:** Human training vs AI deepfakes = losing battle

### How much does Sealfie cost?

€95 per month per user for standard plans. Customized pricing for enterprises based on size and requirements. ROI >150% year 1 makes investment quickly profitable.

**Learn more:**
- **ROI calculation (3-person team):** Cost €3,420/year, time saved €9,000/year, one fraud prevented = infinite ROI
- **Net ROI:** >150% before even counting accelerated payment cycles
- **Deployment:** iOS/Android, active protection same day, easy scalability
