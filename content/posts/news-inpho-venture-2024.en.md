## Inkan.link Participated in Prestigious Inpho Venture Summit 2024

Inkan.link was selected to participate in the [Inpho Venture Summit](https://www.inpho-ventures.com/), joining an elite group of innovative startups at this landmark event. Our team was proud to be featured among the selected participants, as captured in the accompanying photograph.

### A Legacy of Innovation and Investment

Since its inception in 2008, INPHO® Venture Summit has established itself as an exclusive, high-caliber gathering where leading Limited Partners (LPs), investors, and corporate giants converge to shape tomorrow's technological landscape. This invitation-only forum focuses on identifying and funding groundbreaking solutions to address critical global challenges.

The summit has earned its reputation as a premier platform where industry leaders and decision-makers engage in profound, sometimes controversial discussions, share strategic insights, and forge powerful connections. INPHO® carefully curates attendance to include sophisticated investors, influential LPs, and forward-thinking corporates passionate about deeptech investments. Selected startups undergo live challenges, presenting their innovations before this distinguished audience.

### Emerging Concerns: AI and Deepfake Threats

While the summit's primary focus was on energy, industrial, and medical innovations, a notable pattern emerged during the 24-hour event. The threats posed by deepfakes and AI were independently raised three times by different investors, despite not being featured themes. These spontaneous discussions highlighted investors' growing concern and their active search for solutions in this space, particularly regarding the financial sector's vulnerability.

This recurring topic underscores the timeliness of Inkan.link's solution. Our platform directly addresses these emerging challenges by providing robust protection for payment approvals against deepfake threats, while simultaneously streamlining verification processes and enhancing automation capabilities.

### Beyond ESG: Pursuing Transformative Innovation

The summit stood out for its refreshing focus on genuine technological breakthroughs with clear profit potential across energy, industrial, and medical sectors. The winner, Transmutex, exemplifies this approach with their ambitious goal of achieving nuclear fusion through laser technology, while simultaneously addressing nuclear waste recycling and medical isotope production.

Another notable participant aims to revolutionize robotics, challenging industry giant Tesla. These ventures remind us that true entrepreneurship often begins with seemingly impossible goals that eventually become obvious innovations – highlighting the complex yet rewarding nature of strategic investment in breakthrough technologies.
