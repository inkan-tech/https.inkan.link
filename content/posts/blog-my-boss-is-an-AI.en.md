summary: The business email compromise (BEC) fraud is indeed associated with emails, serving as the preferred entry point for attackers who then move on to other channels, notably voice. The democratization of generative AI allows a criminal to obtain real-time voice cloning software for less than 100 euros. Protection based on human detection of a fake voice is destined to fail. Nevertheless, these are the classic recommendations for safeguarding against this fraud. We offer an innovative approach with Sealfie that requires no training.
description: Explore the cutting-edge intersection of AI, voice cloning, and cybersecurity in our latest article. Learn how AI is revolutionizing voice cloning, its implications for identity theft, and the role of innovative solutions like Sealfie in safeguarding businesses. Delve into the future of AI leadership with the case of Madame Tang Yu, the AI CEO in China.

## Do you remember the CEO who is an AI in China?

This article is not a recycling of old news, but rather an exploration of identity theft in the era of AI. You may remember [Madame Tang Yu, the humanoid robot](https://newsrnd.com/business/2022-09-21-%E2%80%9Cmadame-tang-yu%E2%80%9D--a-female-robot-named-ceo-of-a-video-game-company-in-china.B1lc0q_uZi.html), who became the CEO of a publicly traded company in China. This technological advancement has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can now make important business decisions, thus replacing humans in leadership roles. However, today, we are not going to dwell on Tang Yu, but rather on a subject just as important and worrying: voice cloning.

## The technological ease of cloning voices

The article [It's Time to Protect Yourself From AI Voice Scams](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/ai-voice-cloning-imposter-scams/673879/) clearly demonstrates that the creation of synthetic voice models is not only possible, but also increasingly accessible. This achievement highlights a worrying reality: hackers now have the means to create synthetic voice models. It is therefore obvious to anticipate that criminals will specialize in creating models to clone voices and resell them on the darkweb. No technological barrier protects you from these attacks anymore.

## The impact on identity theft detection

In today's digital world, it has become utopian to think that generic cybersecurity training, based on mistakes and poor imitations of criminals, will be enough to protect businesses from impostors. Fraud attempts involving identity theft are becoming more sophisticated and common, and traditional prevention methods are simply no longer up to the task.
