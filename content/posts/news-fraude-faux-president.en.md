[Sealfie](https://sealf.ie/en) was created to protect identity usurpations, first of all, the fake ceo scam.

## The extent of the fraud 

 The "fraud to the president" or "rib" scams have made many victims among French companies. Fraud amounts to millions of euros and also has a dramatic psychological impact on the victims. 

 State agencies speak of it: [CEO fraud: How to protect your organisation from fraudsters(Barclays)](https://www.barclayscorporate.com/insights/fraud-protection/ceo-fraud/)
 Criminals use old usurpation techniques, they have made their digital transitions. No more mission-impossible masks, criminals use technology, usurped emails, telephone numbers, imitate the way and even the video. They are very well informed about the company and their speeches are credible.
## Human in the heart 

 This very targeted attack is long prepared, criminals have risen a credible scenario. Human is their main target. All psychological springs are used to convince the accountant to make an emergency a transfer. These attacks are almost always accompanied by attacks by email systems to set up a credible speech. The attack is much more elaborate than basic phishing, type Nigerian prince, cybersecurity professionals can be caught. 

 The  Federal Trade Commission makes recommendations [here](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/small-businesses/cybersecurity/business)which are summed up as follows: 

 - Remind all employees alert them on the importance of not disclosing information concerning the operation of the company on social networks 
 - Regularly aware of all employees of accounting services, cash, secretariats, standards, of this type of scam. 
 - Get into the habit of systematically informing replacements on these positions. 
 - Establish multiple checks and signatures for international payments. 
 - Break the email chain for letters relating to international transfers by entering the usual address of the principal. 
 - Maintain the computer security system up to date.

Protection by human's discipline and training does not work over time or without constant efforts. This is why we created [Sealfie](https://sealf.ie/en)

[Sealfie](https://sealf.ie/en) is a SaaS and a mobile application. It makes it possible to ensure and be able to verify that people in the transaction are authorized, each time. The application is simple to use, without training, we take care of the technological aspects. 

 When an order of transfer is initiated one of the recorded people, the CEO or the accountant, creates a list of digital certificates, takes a photo describing the transaction, a selfie and uses biometrics. Another authorized person checks adds his selfie and biometrics. We take care of collecting the certificates of other systems if available, such as the wifi of the company for example. 

 We guide people on what they have to do, including in the event of suspected fraud. The digital process becomes the control point, the accountants no longer have to risk being fooled or being afraid of annoying their superiors. 

 ## The technology implemented 

 The approach is to make the transactions of legitimate people reliable and verifiable instead of trying to detect all forms of usurper. The attestations of the maximum of systems used are encrypted, available on a ledger no one can repudiate and linked together on an open blockchain. This makes it possible to check which systems signed. The result is too complex for criminals to make an affordable fake.
