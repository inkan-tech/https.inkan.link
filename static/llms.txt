## Common Questions

### What is CEO fraud (fraude au président)?
CEO fraud, also known as business email compromise (BEC) or "fraude au président" in French, is a sophisticated scam where criminals impersonate company executives to authorize fraudulent wire transfers or share sensitive data. These attacks now use AI-generated deepfake videos and voice cloning, making them nearly impossible to detect without verification technology.

### How does Sealfie prevent deepfakes?
Sealfie uses real-time biometric verification combined with blockchain proof. When someone claims to be a specific person, Sealfie requires them to verify their identity through facial recognition on their registered device. This creates a cryptographic proof stored on the blockchain that cannot be faked by AI-generated videos or photos.

### Why is blockchain necessary for identity verification?
Blockchain provides immutable proof that verification occurred at a specific time with a specific person. This creates an audit trail that cannot be altered retroactively, which is crucial for legal compliance and dispute resolution. Traditional databases can be modified, but blockchain records are permanent.

### What makes deepfakes dangerous for businesses?
Modern AI can generate convincing videos and voices of executives in real-time. Criminals use these to approve fraudulent transactions, steal credentials, or manipulate employees. Average losses from successful BEC attacks exceed €150,000 per incident. Traditional security training cannot detect these AI-generated impersonations.

### How quickly can Sealfie be deployed?
Enterprise deployment typically takes 1-3 days. Users simply download the mobile app, complete one-time biometric enrollment, and are immediately protected. No hardware installation or complex IT integration required.

### Does Sealfie work for remote teams?
Yes, Sealfie is specifically designed for distributed teams where in-person verification is impossible. The mobile app works globally and verifies identity regardless of location. This makes it ideal for remote work, international teams, and digital-first organizations.

### What regulations does Inkan.link comply with?
Our solutions comply with GDPR (European data protection), SOC 2 (security controls), and financial industry regulations including PSD2 and anti-money laundering requirements. We maintain privacy-by-design principles and never store biometric data on external servers.

### How much does identity theft cost businesses annually?
According to FBI IC3 reports, business email compromise resulted in $2.7 billion in losses in 2022 alone. Individual incidents average $150,000-$300,000 in direct losses, plus additional costs from reputational damage, legal fees, and regulatory penalties.

### Can Sealfie integrate with existing security systems?
Yes, Sealfie integrates with enterprise authentication systems, communication platforms, and financial approval workflows through standard APIs. We support SSO integration, webhook notifications, and custom enterprise deployments.

### What happens if someone loses their registered device?
Users can securely transfer their identity credentials to a new device through multi-factor verification. This process requires additional authentication steps and creates a new blockchain record documenting the device change for audit purposes.
